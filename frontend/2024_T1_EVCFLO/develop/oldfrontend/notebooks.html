    <p>In this analysis, we would like to develop a prediction model based on time series data generated from the EVCS dataset in the UK and forecast future energy consumption trends for the next 365 days. Our analysis contains four sections: Data Cleaning,
        Data Exploration, Pattern Recognition, and Prediction Model. The results of evaluation metrics suggest that the model has strong predictive power, while future work directions are also pointed out.</p>

    <p>In this analysis, we will build a Machine Learning model using a Random Forest algorithm based on an EVCS dataset in Netherland to explore the relationships between energy consumption and all other features. We also provide graphical presentations
        of information extracted from our research. The analysis has four main sections: Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Feature Selection, and Prediction Model. Our final model returns an accuracy of 87.33% which provides great prediction power by individual
        transaction records.</p>
